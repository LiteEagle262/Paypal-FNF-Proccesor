# Paypal-FNF-Proccesor
A simple PayPal friends and family processor written in python.

Pretty simple code using the python paypal sdk, just shows a basic example of how to handle paypal fnf payments **VERY SIMPLE VERSION** this is just to get a idea of how to do it and how projects such as sellpass.io are now taking paypal FNF.

**Make sure to STAR the repository and follow me on github for other cool simple projects**
